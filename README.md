# Money App

Die Money App ist eine app zum analysieren, visualisieren und vorhersagen von Verm√∂gen, Ausgaben und einnahmen.
Transactions from different banks can be imported and also created manually. 
These transactions can then be visualized and evaluated in dashboards. 
In addition, a potential forecast can be made by creating contracts and financial targets.
In short, the aim of this app is to get control and an overview of your finances and to have all the important information about them in one place

## Usage

The app consists of a backend ([`actix-web`](https://actix.rs/)) and a frontend ([`yew`](https://yew.rs/)), which are both built together in a Docker image.
The backend communicates with a [`SurrealDB`](https://surrealdb.com/) database.
The app is designed for multi-tenant operation, but does not take care of authentication itself. 
Instead, it relies on an authentication proxy such as [`Proxauth`](https://github.com/xilefmusics/proxauth), which sets the `X-Remote-User` header.

### Production

For productive operation, it is recommended to use the Docker Image, which is already built on [`DockerHub`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/xilefmusics/money-app) for the respective releases.
In addition, the [`SurrealDB`](https://hub.docker.com/r/surrealdb/surrealdb) and [`Proxauth`](https://hub.docker.com/r/xilefmusics/proxauth) image can be used to create a fully functional overall system.
An example configuration can be seen in [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/xilefmusics/money-app/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) and started via `docker compose up`.
